Good Programming is not learned from generalities, 1
but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean, 2
easy to read, easy to maintain and modify, human-engineered, 3
efficient, and reliable, by the application of common sense 4
and good programming practices. Careful study and imitation 5
of good programs leads to better writing. 6
